# ArduinoComputerProject
Welcome, to my computer project.
This project was created using the instructions provided
My timings of the Traffic lights do differ a little bit but that shouldn't alter the performance
Since the photo that was attached to the Word file couldn't be very closely read to make sure the pins go in the right place, I have placed the pins wherever I feel more comfortable. Thanks!
The project has been tried on Wokwi.com and works just fine, enjoy!
